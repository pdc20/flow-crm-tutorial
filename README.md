# Spring Boot and Vaadin Experimentation Code
Purpose is to be a kind of question manager where questions can come from various sources which we call "ArticleSources" here. We can associate each question with multiple tags to make them easier to identify.

Questions can be uploaded by dragging and dropping files in the Question view.

Tags and Sources can be added in their own views.
